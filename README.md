# Voice Mail Player

This app had ~50.000 downloads on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=groomiac.voicemailplayer
). Google removed it because of some policy violation. I wrote the app years ago and did not find time to update it.
Maybe others would like to take over?

ORIGINAL GOOGLE PLAY DESCRIPTION:

"Do you get Voice Mails via e-mail or web access? Have you ever forgotten your headphones (or you do not even have any) and still wanted to listen to your Voice Mails with some privacy (e.g., being in the office or driving by bus)?\n\n" +

"Voice Mail Player plays audio and video files (audio part only) via your Android phone's ear-piece - like as you would take a phone call.\n\n" +

"Voice Mail Player does not(!) include a file picker. It can be started like Android's default media player from any application that deals with media files. It's in the shared apps list. It can be used via gallery, e-mail clients, file pickers, download folder etc.\n\n" +

"This app will not work on devices without ear-pieces (obviously). If you think, your device should be supported but is not, please drop us an e-mail!\n\n" +

"Take a look at the settings to configure Voice Mail Player's behavior for your needs. Of course, you can use your phone's volume control keys as usual."
